## DRR-19-PWA-Text-Editor

## Description
With this project we were tasked to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
